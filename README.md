# Flask Foundation

A Fork of the original Flask-Foundation, but with the following enhancements:
* Login using bcrpyted passwords
* Forms and Models moved into modules
* An ActiveModel Mixing added for db opertations (eg. User.save())
* Account creation example
* Make rename command to rename flocka to something else, eg. make rename flocka=webapp
* Change Password example

#### Getting Started, assumes fully-stocked virtualenv

`make rename somnewapp=somenewapp`

Alembic initialize

`./manage.py db init`

Edit migrations/alembic.ini - a good file_template is:

`%%(year)d-%%(month).2d-%%(day).2d_%%(hour).2d-%%(minute).2d-%%(second).2d_%%(rev)s_%%(slug)s`

Create initial migrations

`./manage.py db migrate`

Apply to database

`./manage.py db upgrade`

Start

`./manage.py runserver`
